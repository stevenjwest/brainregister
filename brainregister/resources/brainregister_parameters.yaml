# source- parameters define the source IMAGE SPACE
#
#   template-path: 
#        Relative path to a VALID TEMPLATE IMAGE.
#         The image defined at this path is used for optimising registration to 
#         the target-template.
#
#   annotations-path (OPTIONAL):
#       Relative path to ANNOTATION IMAGES
#        An annotation image represents image regions with distinct pixel values.
#        If the source data has any annotation images, can declare them under 
#        this list for correct transformation to the target image space.
#
#   images: 
#       Relative path from source-template-path of additional images to be 
#        transformed during registration.
#       NOTE: Any name can be used here in replacement of 'images'
#        eg. source-img-path, etc.
#
#   template-resolution: 
#       Source template image resolution in XYZ - used for matching image 
#        resolutions during downsampling.
#
#   template-size: 
#       Source template image size in XYZ - used for matching image 
#        resolutions during downsampling.
#
#   structure: 
#       What structure is in the source template?  These should be defined in 
#        the TARGET PARAMETER FILE. Use to select subsets of (or 'mask) the 
#        target template for registration.
#       For BrainRegister Allen CCF: whole CNS split into 16 quadrants:
#        4 coronal, 2 sagittal, 2 horizontal:
#          CNS-<LT,RT>-<OLF,FB,MB,HB>-<UPPER,LOWER>
#
#   orientation:
#       How is the source-template oriented?  These should be defined in the 
#        TARGET PARAMETER FILE. Use to ensure registration proceeds with both
#        source and target templates oriented in the same manner.
#       For BrainRegister Allen CCF:  
#        Specify which AXIS and its DIRECTION each image dimension is in order: 
#          eg. XYZ -> LR:SI:PA
#            mediolateral: <LR,RL> for left/right direction
#            dorsoventral: <SI,IS> for superior/inferior direction
#            anteroposterior: <AP,PA> for anterior/posterior direction
#          See documentation:

#        The remaining params are collected from it.

#          See documentation: 
#   template-output:
#       Relative path to the output target parameters file.
#        Following registration, the source image space can be used to register
#         to a new source image space, and this target-template-output file
#         contains the metadata necessary to perform this registration.
#          See documentation:

# downsampling- parameters define how to perform downsampling
#   downsampling moves the higher resolution image between source and target into 
#    the lower resolution image space.
#   This improves registration by ensuring the higher resolution data is 
#    appropriately filtered for optimal alignment during elastix registration.
#
#   filter:
#       Specify an image filter to use on the higher resolution image when 
#        downsampling. Set to 'false' to disable.
#       THIS IS ALWAYS USED as downsampling is always performed unless source 
#        and target template images are same size.
#       The default performs a median filter of radius equal to the resolution 
#        difference in each dimension, removing any noise from data below the 
#        lower resolution, whilst preserving edges effectively.
#
#   prefix:
#       This prefix is put on the front of each file name that is saved to disk.
#
#   save-image-type:
#       Defines what image type any downsampled image saved to disk should be 
#        saved as.
#       Definition is based on image extension.  Default is "nrrd", which is 
#        preferred as it adds data compression to storage.
#       MUST be a VALID simpleITK image type : nrrd, tiff, mhd
#        see https://simpleitk.readthedocs.io/en/master/IO.html
